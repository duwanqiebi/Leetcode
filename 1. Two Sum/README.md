## [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

>Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

>**Example:**

><pre>Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[<b>0</b>] + nums[<b>1</b>] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [<b>0</b>, <b>1</b>].
</pre>
